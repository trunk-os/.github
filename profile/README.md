Trunk is an operating system that runs on YOUR hardware, in YOUR home. Self-configuring cloud storage and compute that keeps your data exactly where it belongs—with you. No corporate servers. No AI surveillance. No compromises.

And, because we want everyone to benefit from this, we're trying to make it as easy to use as possible for anyone. Two clicks to run a nginx, securely, exposed to the world on your home network.

It's not quite ready yet -- but you can try it now. Installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/blob/main/install-instructions.md). Please report issues to the [community repository](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/issues).

**We need your help to keep building.**

Goal: **$3,000 to cover December development costs and rent.** Right now, we're at a critical moment. Continued development depends on support from people who understand what's at stake.

-   Can you chip in $20-$200 today? It helps us survive this month and keep coding.
-   Even better: $10/month means we can plan ahead and accelerate development.
