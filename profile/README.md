Trunk is creating an operating system that runs in your closet and keeps your data there, and only there. We're starting by providing Cloud Storage and Compute, making it easy enough for anyone to run.

Trunk intends to be fully self-configuring on most commodity hardware at the point the machine is powered on the first time, easy to find on your home network and able to power any serving or storage need you might have at a home or small collaborative environment. Our #1 goal is ensuring that nearly anyone can leverage Trunk to get free from hosting solutions which may be feeding your data to AI services or compromising your privacy or freedom. We develop in the open to foster trust in our implementation to preserve privacy and personal soverignty.

Instructions for trying Trunk are [here](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/blob/main/install-instructions.md). Please report issues to the [community repository](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/issues). Issues in other repositories may be ignored or closed indiscriminantly. The community funnel allows me to create tickets where they belong in the projects they belong in, while still addressing your issues.
