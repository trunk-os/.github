Trunk is creating an operating system that runs in your closet and keeps your data there, and only there. We're starting by providing Cloud Storage and Compute, making it easy enough for anyone to run.

There are a lot of novel features (package management, storage and network integration, easy installation)! Check out more about the project here: https://trunk-os.github.com

Instructions for trying Trunk are [here](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/blob/main/install-instructions.md). Please report issues to the [community repository](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/issues). Issues in other repositories may be ignored or closed indiscriminantly. The community funnel allows me to create tickets where they belong in the projects they belong in, while still addressing your issues.

More coming here! Be sure to [Follow Us on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/trunk-os.bsky.social).

**I COULD USE YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT.** If you like what you see here, throw me $20 if you can afford it.
