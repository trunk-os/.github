Trunk is creating an operating system that runs in your closet and keeps your data there, and only there. We're starting by providing Cloud Storage and Compute, making it easy enough for anyone to run.

Instructions for trying Trunk are [here](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/blob/main/install-instructions.md). Please report issues to the [community repository](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/issues). Issues in other repositories may be ignored or closed indiscriminantly. The community funnel allows me to create tickets where they belong in the projects they belong in, while still addressing your issues.
